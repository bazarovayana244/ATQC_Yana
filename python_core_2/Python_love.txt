This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system
Be aware that it expects you to have a basic understanding of programming in general.
It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience,
but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
